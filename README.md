# Notaroo Data loader for Signing Order

This Chrome extension streamlines the process of populating Signing Order's order forms with data from spreadsheets.

## Usage 

The extension supports loading data from .xlsx and .csv files. Once the data is imported, it is displayed in a user-friendly data grid. You can select a row and click the Insert button to automatically fill the corresponding form fields on the page with the row's values.

The extension also keeps track of the loaded data and highlights already inserted orders in green, ensuring you can easily see which orders have been processed.
